How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped because it's easy to see differences that are shown with pluses and minuses.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It makes you efficient because you can reflect at old versions if your new versions don't work very well.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Good thing is that you have full control when to save, but the bad thing is that some changes may be overseen.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because when working on big projects tracking each file separately could be hard task. In Google Docs, files are mostly unrelated and therefore tracking changes is not that hard.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Simply enter git log and you'll see all logs. With using git diff you can see changes between logs that you want.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
With git you are more confident to make changes that could break something because you can do checkout and restore previous state.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try using it for reviewing changes in code.
